<h2 id="info">Greetings</h2>
Welcome to each of you, past customers and prospective - alike! July 1, 2022

<b>Is the Coronavirus really behind us?</b> Happily, the nursery has been relatively unaffected by the virus since June of 2020. We understand that is not everyone's experience by far. We are sorry if you experienced loss.

<b>Prices: </b> Inflation is real and largely the product of politician's attempts to make sure we had extra money to get through Covid. In our view, blame is equally shared among Trump's PPP program, Biden's huge spending and the Treasury's attempts to increase the money supply. Good thing the BBB proposal didn't go through or the prices we all pay for groceries, gas, etc would be even higher! Because of their poor stewardship of the economy, our prices are raised. My advice is to vote for candidates that have better economic advisors, as this is a DISASTER!

<b>A quick reminder of important terms to help us do a better job of serving you:</b> <br><br>

Reductions to orders accepted till <u>March 15th. After that, you may add to your order but not subtract.</u> <br><br>
If an order is cancelled after March 15th, 50% of the order total is payable; if before that date--then 25%.
Note that all orders placed are based on the full terms and conditions of our company as listed on page 19.
<b>The effects of very high demand:</b> <br><br>

<u>Allocation:</u> We are moving more toward a system of allocating inventory - so there are more plants available for smaller growers. Practically, this means that there are less evergreen plants available for 1000 rate sales. <br><br>
<u>Price increases:</u> See above to reference the reasons for this. <br><br>
<u>Increased Production:</u> While we're always on the lookout for additional ground, we are limited in production to our current acreage so we are not able to balance increased demand with increased production. <br><br>
Now on to <span style="color:#FF0033;font-weight:bold;">what's new </span>or deserves special note: As in prior years, our new native offerings are printed in <span style="color:#FF0033;font-weight:bold;">RED</span> ink.
<br>

<b>Notable misses for this year are:</b> Am. Crabapple, Showy Mtn Ash, Sassafras, Wahoo, Creep. Juniper, Apricot.

<b>Note: Minimum quantity to order per species is the bundle size.</b> We will no longer be able to process orders in less than bundle size quantities. Minimum order per species/size is the appropriate bundle size quantity.								
<br>
<br>
    Difficult to establish plants!! If you see a
    <span style="color:#FF0033;"><b>
        red asterisk sign, “ * “</b>
    </span>    
    behind a species in the catalog - this indicates a species 
    that can be difficult to transplant. Like all other plants we grow, they are sold at your own risk.
  </span>
<br>
<br>
  <span style="font-weight:bold;">
      Soil Conservation Districts:
    </span>
  We supply many districts with plants for their annual sales. Since districts generally act as a local distributor, we offer a discount on the pricing for those orders compared to normal catalog terms.
    <span style="color:#FF0033;font-weight:bold;">
      <u> Again in 2022-23, for Conservation Districts</u>: please limit your order to 22 species or less. </span>
    
<b> We need to minimize order variety to be more efficient for orders shipped in April... Thank you.
</b>
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0033;font-weight:bold;">
Minimum order is $150. Minimum shipping is raised to $37.50 this year</span> <b>- please note. </b>
</span> Note that if actual cost of shipping product is greater than the flat charge, we will bill you for the difference after we ship.
<br>
    This catalog 
    
    <b>assumes</b> that you know what species you need for your project. Call if you need help!
    Often, the easiest way to gain information is to do an internet search. The following are good sites:

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    
      <b>How do I find out current availability?</b>
    <br>
      We do not post availability online. Please give us a call (269 857 7804) for an updated list of what's available.
    <br>
    <br>
      <b>What forms of payment are accepted?</b>
    <br>
      We only accept checks and money orders; no credit/debit cards please.
    <br>
    <br>
      <b>How do you ship bare-root plants?</b>
    <br>
      To make sure that plants arrive in good condition, plants are packed with sphagnum moss with a plastic liner in a corrugated cardboard box. Most orders are shipped via UPS and large orders can be shipped on pallets via LTL.
    <br>
    <br>
      <b>What is your guarantee on seedlings?</b>
    <br>
      Plants are guaranteed to leave the nursery in good condition. We do not warranty plant survival because many factors that affect plant survival are outside of our control. Please see <a href="informationtermsandconditions.html" id="item" class="eleven">terms & conditions</a> for complete details.
    <br>
    <br>
      <b>How do you price plants?</b>
    <br>
      For plants less than 24" tall, the catalogue lists pricing as "1000 rate" -- for a minimum of 500 per individual species. For plants 24" and taller (found in our <a href="biggerstuffpageone.html" id="item" class="eleven"> Bigger Stuff<a/>) the listed price is "100 rate."
    <br>
    <br>
      <b>When is the best time of year to order trees?</b>
    <br>
      We are experiencing good demand for our products currently and this translates into reduced availability as we go through the sales season.  We begin writing orders when the new catalog comes out in July.  To have the best selection, you should order as soon as feasible after that time.  There are a lot of species, for which we are the only bare-root grower in America.  When these sell-out, they’re gone.  Some of the willows, Russet Buffaloberry, Leatherwood, Balsam Poplar and Bearberry fit into this category.  Other items like Pin Oak, Sugar Maple, Jack Pine Red Osier Dogwood are generally in good supply and are available through the season.  When the calendar changes to March, our priority shifts to the shipping of existing orders.  We do not staff the office as much and availability is much reduced.  We still write a lot of new orders after March 1st, but it takes longer to process since it competes with shipping, so we appreciate your patience in getting them written and getting those orders scheduled for shipment.


    <br>
    <br>
      <b>How do I plant my trees?</b>
    <br>
      Please take a look at our <a href="informationplantinginstructions.html" id="item" class="eleven">
planting instructions</a> for more information.
    <br>
    <br>
      <b>Do you have an order form?</b>
    <br>
      Yes! <a href="informationorderform.html" id="item" class="eleven">
Here's the link.</a>
    <br>
    <br>
      <b>What are your hours?</b>
    <br>
      Normal business hours are from 8-5. During spring our hours are longer, in the summer our office hours are typically shorter. If no one is around the office to take your call, please leave us a voicemail and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
    <br>
    <br>
      <b>When should I arrange for shipping?</b>
    <br>
      One of the more difficult things we deal with in the nursery is shipping.  Since we can only ship bare-root plants when they are dormant, we have a limited time to ship our product.  Shipping begins in the fall when plants are dormant and continues through winter.  It hits a crescendo in late March, continuing for about five weeks, until very late in April when it slows down to a manageable level and we begin to focus on the growing of plants again.  To make sure that we can meet our promised ship dates we limit the amount of plants (cumulatively) that we schedule to ship on a given week.  Once a week is scheduled full, we help people find the next available week and so on.  Usually by the 10th-15th of March, the last week in March and first three weeks of April are filled up with reservations and customers thereafter need to choose to receive their order earlier in the season or choose a date after April 25th.
    <br>
    <br>   
We are sorry that we cannot always give you your first preference for a specific week of shipping...but one thing I am quite sure of--is that if you choose your week by January 1st--you will normally get your first choice for shipping.  If you haven’t scheduled by mid-February...we will contact you , with a nudge to say that “It’s time to pick a date!”. For those of you who have cold storage facilities, I urge you to receive your plants earlier in the season—before March 25th.  This will help us to even out our shipping schedule and offer better service to those who do not have the option of storing plants for a long period of time.  For those of you who have a smaller order (one or two boxes) you can empty the box and store the bag with trees in your refrigerator for a couple weeks with no trouble--but keep it pretty tightly sealed to keep the plant roots moist. An extra benefit of taking your order early is that if we have an unexpected inventory issue, it will probably not show up on your order!

          Corrections to inventory:
        </span>
    
    <br>
    
        While a conservative and accurate inventory is our goal, at times we do
not have enough plants to fill all our orders. Our policy in those cases is to share the impact of
that reality as broadly as possible to make any change to your order - a minor impact.
